# LabelGenerator
This is a little tool to generate labels. 
In project SPP 2089 each sample assigns with a lable. This lable creates from the type of a sample plus the environment, the date of sampling and the place in which the sample is. Create this kind of label is not easy. Automatically creating a code by entering the introductions is safe and easy for humans.
